# Staff List Manager

A simple desktop app for creating printable A4 staff photo lists. Built specifically for Danish healthcare/workplace environments.

## What it does

- Load staff photos from folders (expects Danish naming: "Fornavn Efternavn - Stilling.jpg")
- Creates two sections: "Administrationen" and "Sygeplejersker"
- Click photos to mark as "praktikant" (intern) with blue border
- Prints to A4 with optimal layout

## Download

Check the [Releases](../../releases) page for the Windows executable. No setup required.

## Note

This is a very specific tool built for a particular use case. It's probably not what you're looking for unless you work in Danish healthcare and need to make staff photo sheets with this exact format.
